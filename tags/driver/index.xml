      <title>GPGPU, ML Inference, and Vulkan Compute</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays GPUs are utilized for both graphics rendering and general-purpose
compute (GPGPU). For the latter, CUDA is the indisputable leading solution.
Though, with so many other GPU vendors, the quest for a GPGPU standard never
stops. OpenCL was a great attempt and is used widely; but still it falls
short on many aspects.
Given the success of Vulkan in graphics and it being both a graphics and
compute API, one would wonder whether it can actually be the next-generation
GPGPU standard. I certainly believe so; but the road is not full of roses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sampling Performance Counters from Mobile GPU Drivers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;../android-linux-gpu-drivers-internals-and-resources&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; I gave a general introduction
to GPU driver internals in Android/Linux systems. Following up with it, today
I will explain how a specific functionality, hardware performance counter
(perf counter) queries, is handled in both Qualcomm Adreno and ARM Mali drivers,
by walking through the kernel driver source code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Android/Linux GPU Drivers: Internals and Resources</title>
      <link>https://www.lei.chat/posts/android-linux-gpu-drivers-internals-and-resources/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been working on a library that needs to directly interact with
GPU kernel drivers from various vendors on Android/Linux systems. Compared to
various GPU APIs, information at this level is quite sparse; so it is not a
straightforward task, to say the least, and ends up requiring me to piece
multiple sources together to figure out the details. So I am logging these driver
internals and resources down in case it can be useful to others that are
interested in these low-level bits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
