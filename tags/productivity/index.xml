      <description>&lt;p&gt;Compilers are often critical components in various development toolchains that
boosts developer productivity.
A compiler is normally used as a monolithic black box that consumes a high-level
source program and produces a semantically-equivalent low-level one.
It is still structured inside though; what flows between internal layers
are called intermediate representations (IRs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRs are critical to compilers. Like there are many compilers, there are also
many IRs in use.
I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to have direct experience with three major schools of IRs or
infrastructures thus far&amp;mdash;LLVM IR, SPIR-V, MLIR, particularly extensively for
the last two, where I both joined development in an early stage.
So I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a series of blog posts to log down my understanding of
compilers and IRs. Hopefully it could be beneficial to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
